Welcome to Scavenger Osint GUI! We are currently working on a discord server to manage support for this expansive tool so you can look forward to an upcoming update. 

Scavenger is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application designed for Open Source Intelligence (OSINT) purposes. OSINT involves gathering and analyzing information from publicly available sources to obtain valuable insights. Here's a brief overview of the tool:

Project: Scavenger OSINT GUI

Description:
Scavenger OSINT GUI is a Python-based application that facilitates OSINT investigations through various functionalities. The tool integrates with external services, such as Google Search and Serpapi, to collect information based on user-provided queries. It supports features like web searches, social profile identification, forum page detection, and mentions tracking.

Key Features:

    Web Search: Conducts Google searches based on user queries and retrieves relevant results.
    Social Profile Identification: Identifies social profiles associated with the provided search query.
    Forum Page Detection: Recognizes potential forum pages based on the search results.
    Mentions Tracking: Monitors and logs instances where the search query is mentioned in the results.
    User Interface: Utilizes PyQt5 for a graphical interface with multiple tabs for displaying results, errors, social profiles, forum pages, mentions, and actions.

Additional Information:

    The tool supports asynchronous operations for improved performance and responsiveness.
    It uses various Python libraries, including BeautifulSoup for web scraping, httpx for asynchronous HTTP requests, and PyQt5 for GUI development.
    The GUI features different tabs for organizing and presenting various types of information obtained during the OSINT investigation.
    The tool incorporates color-coded displays to enhance readability and distinguish between different types of information.

Usage:
Users can input a search query and specify the number of desired search results. The tool then performs a web search, identifies social profiles and potential forum pages, and logs mentions. The results are displayed in the corresponding tabs within the GUI.
